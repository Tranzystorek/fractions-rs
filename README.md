# libfractions - A Rust rational fraction library

## About

This is a library that provides rational fractions,
i.e. values in form $\frac c d$ where $c \in \mathbb{Z}$, $d \in \mathbb{z}^+$.

The aim is mostly to practice creating real projects in rust,
with all typical elements (unit tests, documentation, etc.).
